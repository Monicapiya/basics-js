/*
The trim() method is useful for removing the leading and trailing whitespace from a string. Begin by opening the main.js file. You’ll remove a quote by Philip Roth. The quote contains a lot of whitespace before and after the quote.
 
At this time, if you observe the output of the app, you’ll see the leading and trailing whitespace.
