<!--
The web is all about interaction. And interaction is made possible by way of the event system. In a nutshell, an event is an occurrence like the click of a button, the user typing in an input field, scrolling the page, moving the mouse pointer and several others. As a developer you can assign specialized asynchronous functions which are set to execute every time a given event occurs. This is made possible using an event listener, a special method that watches for an event on a given element and executes an attached callback function when the event occurs.
 
The webpage for this exercise displays four buttons, each named after an illustrious icon from world history. The objective is to see a quote by the individual once the button is pressed. Open the src/index.html if not open already and observe the HTML markup. There is an h1 tag with the id ‘quote’. This is where the quote should be displayed.
 
The buttons each have a unique id. Now open the src/js/index.js file. You’ll notice we have an object called quotes with a quote each from the individuals listed on the page.
